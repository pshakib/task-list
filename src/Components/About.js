      <p>Hello people! This is my first react project. By now, you must have explored the task list app. The home tab displays all your current tasks which you have added through add-tasks tab. You can also simply delete the task you want. The page wont reload when you toggle between different tabs or add or delete the tasks. </p>
    </div>
